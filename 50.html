  <h3>Solutions</h3>
  <h4>Size</h4>
  <pre>
   01| "mem 2" = nearest "printer"
   **| jmp01:
   02| takeFrom "mem 2"
   03| if SW == "mem 3"
   04|| giveTo SW
   05| "mem 3" = calc "mem 3" + "1"
   06| if "mem 3" > 4
   07|| "mem 3" = calc "mem 3" - "4"
   08| jump jmp01
  </pre>
  <h4>Speed</h4>
  <pre>
   01| "mem 1" = nearest "datacube"
   02| "mem 2" = nearest "shredder"
   03| takeFrom S
   04| if "mem 1" == "1"
   05|| jump jmp04
   06| if "mem 1" == "2"
   07|| jump jmp03
   08| if "mem 1" == "3"
   09|| jump jmp01
   10| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   11| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   **| jmp01:
   **| jmp02:
   12| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   13| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   **| jmp03:
   14| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   15| tell "everyone" "Hi!"
   **| jmp04:
   16| giveTo "mem 2"
   17| takeFrom SW
   18| jump jmp02
  </pre>
  The size solution is just counting. The speed solution just requires finding commands that take just as long as "giveTo" (with a movement) and "takeFrom." I count this as a difficulty 2, since you have to test the commands to find their speeds.
