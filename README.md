This repository contains complete optimized solutions to the parallel computer programming game 7 Billion Humans, which is the sequel to Human Resource Machine. All the solutions presented here are my own work. They were produced in my second playthrough of the game, where my (successful) goal was to meet or exceed the best known size and speed optimizations at the time of game release. Good solutions for many problems seemed hard to find online, so I decided to post my collection. I have written them up by hand in Notepad, presented in HTML format, so there is probably at least one typo somewhere.
